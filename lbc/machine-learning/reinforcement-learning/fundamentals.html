        <h2>Concept</h2>
        <p>Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make sequences of decisions by interacting with an environment. It aims to maximize a cumulative reward signal over time by taking actions based on the current state.</p>

        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>The purpose of reinforcement learning is to enable an agent to learn optimal policies for decision-making in dynamic and uncertain environments. It is widely used in areas such as robotics, game playing, and autonomous systems.</p>
